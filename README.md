This project demonstrates best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly web applications with a focus on cloud-native principles.

## Features

- ‚ú® Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS
- ‚ö° Fast development with Vite
- ‚úÖ Add, complete, and delete tasks
- üîí Simple authentication (login/register)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Ready for cloud deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Azure Static Web Apps, etc.)
- üß© Modular component structure

## Cloud Native Principles

- **Stateless UI**: All state is managed client-side or via APIs.
- **Ready for CI/CD**: Easily deployable to any cloud static hosting.
- **Scalable**: Modular codebase for easy extension and maintenance.
